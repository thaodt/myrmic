///   wire but the response has not been received, so the next caller would
///   read a response that was not intended for it.
/// - Cancelled *during* the write (B2c): every public operation runs under
///   [`TAP_CALL_TIMEOUT`], and a timeout that fires while `write_frame` is
///   parked — e.g. the peer's receive buffer filled mid-frame — drops this
///   future with a partial frame on the wire.  `write_all` is all-or-nothing
///   only with respect to errors, not cancellation, so a connection that
///   survived this would carry a corrupted framing boundary and desynchronise
///   the next caller.

/// The guard is therefore armed BEFORE the write and disarmed only after a
/// fully decoded response; any earlier exit, by error or by drop, takes the
